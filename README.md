# Priority-Stack
An implementation of priority stack based on a red-black tree concept

The data is stored in a red-black tree with nodes containing priority value and a LIFO stack instance for storing value of the same priority. Memory is allocated and freed dynamically. Both Pop and Push operations require time O(log(n)). Clear operation requires O(n) time.
